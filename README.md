The primary objective of the project was to develop a machine learning model for process monitoring of ultrasonic welding that enables both the classification into different welding classes and the prediction of pull-out force. The development process was guided by the CRISP-DM standard.

In the folder “developmentsteps”, all programming work carried out during the implementation of the research project can be found.

The folder “Artefact” contains the final result, which includes a summary of the best models from the development phase that can be retrained using custom data.

The folder “GUI” contains a prototypical implementation of a graphical user interface based on the data from the research project.
